                    <p className={styles.aboutUsP}>Cycle Fix first opened in 2015 as a bicycle repair shop on the Old Kent Road. Founded by brothers Terry and Damian Purchase, this family-owned and managed local bike shop developed quickly.</p>
                    <p className={styles.aboutUsP}>By 2018 our business had grown well enough that we moved our bike repair shop to Kennington Road, at the site formally owned by Balfeâ€™s Bikes. This move allowed us to develop even further, investing in a retail section for accessories, unique specialist bike repair tools, and five bike repair workshops with plenty of space to spare.</p>
                    <p className={styles.aboutUsP}>Today we run the store with a small but knowledgeable team who are passionately committed to their work. We pride ourselves on our dedication to customer satisfaction: a service that is reflected in our positive customer reviews.</p>
